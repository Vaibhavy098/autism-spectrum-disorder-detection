# AI-Based Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection (Ongoing Project)

## Overview
This project aims to explore the use of deep learning techniques to identify behavioral
patterns associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using video-based data. The
system focuses on analyzing visual cues extracted from videos to support early-stage
behavioral analysis in an academic and research-oriented setting.

The project is being developed as part of a team-based academic initiative.

## Problem Statement
Autism Spectrum Disorder is typically identified through behavioral assessments, which
can be time-consuming and require expert observation. This project investigates whether
deep learning models can assist in analyzing visual behavioral patterns from video data
to support ASD detection research.

## Approach
- Video data preprocessing and frame extraction using OpenCV  
- Feature learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Experimentation with lightweight deep learning models  
- Model training, validation, and performance evaluation
