# AI-Based Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection (Ongoing Project)

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting behavioral patterns associated with Autism Spectrum
Disorder using deep learning techniques on video data. The implementation includes
data preprocessing, frame extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Model
The project experiments with CNN-based architectures, with a lightweight MobileNetV2
model used for final evaluation.

## Dataset Note
The dataset contains sensitive image and video data of children and is not included
in this repository to maintain privacy and ethical standards.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- CNN, MobileNetV2

## Project Status
This is an ongoing academic project. Current work focuses on data preprocessing,
model experimentation, and evaluation. Additional improvements and enhancements
are planned as part of future development.
